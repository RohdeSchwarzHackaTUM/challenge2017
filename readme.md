## Take our Challenge
Code software to analyze video frames. We provide a rich dataset consisting of 50000 categorized frames from various German TV stations. Use AI and computer vision to automatically detect or classify station logos or excite us by finding an alternative usage for the data.

Discuss on [Slack](https://hackatum2017.slack.com) #rohde-schwarz.

## Goals
- Detect logos
- Classify logos
- Find exciting alternative usages for the data

Explain to us how to use your code on another dataset. No python interface required.

## Documentation
A `.html` documentation for this repo can be generated by using `doxygen`.
```
sudo apt-get install doxygen graphviz
cd doc
doxygen Doxyfile
xdg-open html/index.html
```

# Dataset
Grab an USB stick with the data from our booth.

## About the dataset
The dataset consists of video frames recorded from various German free-to-air programs. Every 15 minutes a recording of 9 images was triggered. Additionally, the images were manually grouped depending on sender logos showing up in the frames. This is reflected in the folder structure. There is a file named `metadata.txt` in each subfolder which describes the available logos.

## Filename string
The images are named according to the following format:
```
<serviceID>_<date>_<time>_[0-8].jpg
```
- `serviceID` is a unique id for each service
- `date` and `time` specify the capture timestamp

## Format of `metadata.txt`
The file named `metadata.txt` in each subfolder describes the logos. For each logo, there is one line in the file.
```
<logo category>,<xMin>,<xMax>,<yMin>,<yMax>
```
The `logo category` is a string naming the logo. The position and the size are measured in pixels. `xMin`, `xMax`, `yMin` and `yMax` describe the bounding box for a logo.

# Python library
A python library is provided to read the dataset. Feel free to use any other programming language to work with our data.

## Setup
The provided python scripts require `numpy` and `scikit-image`. Install on Ubuntu 16.04.
```
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip python3-numpy
pip3 install -U scikit-image
```

## Scripts
Several scripts demonstrate how to use the library.
- `dataset_info.py`

Illustrate images of the three difficulty levels.
- `show_dataset.py`
- `show_corner_dataset.py`
- `show_simpledataset.py`
